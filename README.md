# GameboyMacro
3d Files for a Gameboy Macro body. I followed the tutorial on gameboymacro.com to make mine.

Things to keep in mind if you use this to 3d print your faceplate:

  * I have no 3d printer experience, so don't know if this will turn out fine
  * It does machine well on a desktop CNC machine
  * It assumes the resistive touch membrane is disconnected and removed
  * There is still some room between the bottom of the faceplate and the screen
